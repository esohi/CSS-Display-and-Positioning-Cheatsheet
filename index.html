            <h2>Flow of HTML</h2>
            <article class="content">
                <p>A browser will render the elements of an HTML document that has no CSS from left to right, top to
                    bottom,
                    in the same order as they exist in the document. This is called the <strong>flow</strong> of
                    elements in
                    HTML.</p>
                <p>In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS includes properties that
                    change how a browser <em>positions</em> elements. These properties specify where an element is
                    located
                    on a page, if the element can share lines with other elements, and other related attributes.</p>
                <p>Five properties for adjusting the position of HTML elements in the browser include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Position</li>
                    <li>Display</li>
                    <li>Z-index</li>
                    <li>Float</li>
                    <li>Clear</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Block-level elements create a block the full width of their parent elements, and they prevent other
                    elements from appearing in the same horizontal space. Block-level elements take up their own line of
                    space and therefore don't overlap each other. In a browser, you can see block-level elements also
                    consistently appear on the left side of the browser. This is the <em>default position</em> for
                    block-level elements.</p>

                <p>The z-index property accepts <strong>integer values</strong>. Depending on their values, the

            <h2>Float</h2>
            <article class="content">
                <p>The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text
                    and inline elements to wrap around it. The float property is commonly used for wrapping text around
                    an image. A floating element is one where the computed value of float is not <em>none</em>.</p>
                <p>As float implies the use of the block layout, it modifies the computed value of the display
                    values, in some cases. For example, with display set to either inline or inline-block, the
                    computed value would render <strong>block</strong>.</p>
                <p>Note, however, that moving elements left or right for layout purposes is better suited for tools
                    like CSS grid and flexbox, which you’ll learn about later on.</p>
